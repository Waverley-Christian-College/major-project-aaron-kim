#Is It a Good Time to Buy This Stock?

This Python script helps determine whether it's a good time to **buy**, **sell**, or **hold** a stock by calculating:
-  The **short-term (e.g., 5-day)** moving average
-  The **long-term (e.g., 200-day)** moving average
-  (Coming soon) Graham Number and valuation metrics

It pulls historical stock data from the **Tiingo API**, performs the analysis, and gives a final recommendation.
