#Is It a Good Time to Buy This Tool? 

This Python script helps determine whether it's a good time to **buy**, **sell**, or **hold** a stock by calculating:
-  The **short-term (e.g., 50-day)** moving average
-  The **long-term (e.g., 200-day)** moving average
-  (Coming soon) Graham Number and valuation metrics

It pulls historical stock data from the **Tiingo API**, performs the analysis, and gives a final recommendation.

Special Features 
Calculates short-term and long-term moving averages
Fetches stock price data securely using your Tiingo API token
Advises whether to buy, sell, or hold based on moving averages
Detects Golden Cross and Death Cross patterns
Handles errors gracefully (invalid input, API errors)
Automatically calculates the necessary date range based on the longest moving average period
Saves the price and moving averages graph as an image file (<TICKER>_moving_averages.png)

### How to Run the Script (Without GitHub)

1. **Install Python**
   Download and install Python from the official website:
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Install Required Packages**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   pip install requests numpy
   ```

3. **Set Your Tiingo API Token**

   * Get your Tiingo API token from [https://api.tiingo.com/](https://api.tiingo.com/)
   * Set it as an environment variable named `API_TOKEN` on your system
     (or update the script to insert your token directly for testing)

4. **Download the Python script** (e.g., `stock_analysis.py`) and save it locally.

5. **Run the script** from your terminal/command prompt:

   ```bash
   python stock_analysis.py
   ```

6. **Follow the prompts** to enter:

   * The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL)
   * The date you want to analyze (YYYY-MM-DD)
   * The number of days for short-term and long-term moving averages


DEMO:
Fetching data from 2024-08-15 to 2025-06-11...

AAPL Stock Data:
Short-term (50-day) Moving Average: 202.46
Long-term (200-day) Moving Average: 224.75

ðŸ“Š Trading Signal Analysis

Recommendation: BEARISH + SELL
Reason: ðŸ“‰ Death Cross detected â€“ short-term moving average is below the long-term.
END RESULT

(Graph)


The script will then fetch data, calculate moving averages, create a graph and give you a buy/hold/sell recommendation.
