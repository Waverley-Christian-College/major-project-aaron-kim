# 💸 Is it a good time to buy?

This Python script checks if it's a good time to buy a stock by calculating the 5-day moving average (MA), the 200-day moving average (MA), and the Graham Number. The user inputs a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT), and the script fetches the necessary data from the Tiingo API to perform the analysis.


## 🚀 Instructions

1. How to run it:

Get stock data from the tinggo api
Ask the user for input
Analyze the data, for example ups and downs and show a graph
Add reccomendations; should the user invest, wait, or not invest
